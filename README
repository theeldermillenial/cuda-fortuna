# Cuda Fortuna

This is a very WIP implementation of a cuda miner for fortuna.

It does not integrate well with any of the existing typescript miners. I created a
custom piece of Typescript code for testing that dumps the datum to a text file that
is read by this miner, and used for hashing. When a datum is discovered, it dumps the
nonce to a file that is read and submitted to the chain.

Currently the leading zeros and difficulty is hard coded.

Just to repeat, this is very WIP. This is probably not usable by most miners unless they
can code.

# Build

I only built and tested with Cuda 12.2.

To build, do `make gpu_miner`
